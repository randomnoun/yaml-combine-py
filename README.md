A python version of the [swagger-combine-maven-plugin][swagger-combine-maven-plugin]

This is the README file for the project.

Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not a
good idea, although a simple “What's New” section for the most recent version
may be appropriate.
